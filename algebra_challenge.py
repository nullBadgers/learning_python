# Create a variable called a and set it equal to 20851 plus 92421
a = 20851+92421

# Create a variable called b and set it equal to 90234 minus 4314.5
b = 90234-4314.5

# Create a variable called c and set it equal to 5678 multiplied by 2341
c = 5678*2341

# Create a variable called d and set it equal to 993 divided by 456
d = 993/456

# Create a variable called e and set it equal to the remainder from 
# dividing 500 by 3 
e = 500%3
